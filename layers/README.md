# ATT&CK Navigator Layers

A layer constitutes a set of annotations on the ATT&CK matrix for a specific technology domain. Layers can also store a default configuration of the view such as sorting, visible platforms, and more. The ATT&CK Navigator includes functionalities for exporting annotations into layer files, as well as the ability to import layer files for viewing.

See the [layer format specification](LAYERFORMATv3.md) for more information about Layer files.

This folder also contains sample layers (in the [data/samples](data/samples) folder), layers showing changes to the ATT&CK knowledge base (in the [data/update_layers](data/update_layers) folder), and a script demonstrating the programmatic generation of layers from csv (in the [attack_layers](attack_layers) folder).

*Also, feel free to come up with your own ideas for layer file generation, and contribute them to the community by making a pull request to the ATT&CK Navigator!*
